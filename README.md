# flask-image-labelling

Creating a simple UI to label images

# Running application:
To run simply run the `test.py` file
To store image data fro labelling, create a folder `static/uploads` in current directory and store image data there.

# TODO:

1. Feature to drag and drop images ("/" )
2. Feature to remove a file from uploadswithout a label
3. Move left right with arrow keys
4. Feature to remove labels
5. Use css and clean up code:
  - Make it more object oriented -- see best practices
  - Use request.url and other flask features
  - Keep constants in different file from test.py
